# Central Park Squirrel Census Analysis

This is an analysis of the Central Park squirrel census. It contains information on the behaviors of different squirrels in Central Park. This dataset has the exact coordinates of where squirrels were observed, their colors, activities, communications, and interactions with humans. All of this data was collected by volunteer observers through the month of October in 2018. With this data we sought to answer the following questions: Correlation between behaviors and location?	More specifically, Correlation between primary fur colors and location? Correlation between primary fur colors and behaviors exhibited around other squirrels? Correlation between primary fur colors and behaviors exhibited around humans?

Using python we created pie charts to visualize the population breakdown by color and heat maps to display the density of each primary fur color. Interestingly, we discovered that black squirrels seem to be observed in the areas where gray squirrels are not. With our analysis of vocalizations we found that black squirrels showed higher levels of quaas then other squirrels. A quaa is a form of communication used to indicate a predator has passed but is still in the area.

We noticed when creating density maps for squirrel activities (running, climbing, chasing, foraging, and eating) that squirrels were primarily foraging in a large wooden area of the park. This high density of foraging is not matched in the same levels in the eating map. This could suggest that squirrels are preparing for winter and stockpiling food as these observations were noted shortly before winter.

While this data set is complete there are some hindrances to it. There is a heavy skew towards gray colored squirrels which could affect how analysis is done. Another fault is within vocalizations. This is all based on what an observer notices and if the observer isn't able to notice a vocalization it couldn't be noted. The presence of the observer can also affect the behavior of squirrels. Squirrels may not be comfortable to forage when a perceived threat is there.
